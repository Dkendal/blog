* Dylan Kendal's blog
  
  This is my personal blog. It's written as a single [[./content-org/index.org][org-mode document]],
  which is coverted to markdown for Hugo with ox-hugo, which is then
  built to HTML with Hugo, and is finally deployed as a GitHub pages web
  page.

** Building
   This project uses a [[https://github.com/apenwarr/redo/][redo]] [[./all.do][build script]] to convert org to markdown, run Hugo, and run some other code generation scripts.
   
   #+begin_src bash
   redo
   #+end_src
   
   Builds everything, then it just needs to be committed and pushed to GitHub.
